# Web File Sharing Service with Distributed Blocklist  

## üìå Overview  
This project is a prototype implementation of a **web-based file sharing service** that integrates a **distributed blocklist** to prevent unauthorized file distribution. The system allows users to **upload, download, block, and unblock files**, while administrators can moderate requests via a dedicated interface.  

The main objective is to demonstrate:  
- File sharing functionality through a Laravel web application.  
- Blocklist enforcement using SHA-256 hashes.  
- Secure and user-friendly interaction across frontend, backend, and database.  

This project was developed as part of the **Datenbanken und Web-Techniken** course at **TU Chemnitz**.
